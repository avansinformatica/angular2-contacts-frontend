# Angular Contacts App

This is an Angular2 frontend application that uses the [node contacts API](https://github.com/avansinformatica/node-contacts-api). Make sure it is running before starting this application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.0.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
